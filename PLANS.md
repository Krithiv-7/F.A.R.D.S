# Plan Mapping: Connecting High-Level Goals to Detailed Implementation

  This document maps the phases from the main `PLANS.md` file to the detailed, step-by-step implementation guides located in the `docs/phases/` directory.

  ### Your Phase 1: Planning & Research
  * **Status:** âœ… **Complete**
  * **Comment:** All the work we have done up to this point, including defining the case scenario and creating the 9-phase plan, fulfills this requirement.

  ### Your Phase 2: Hardware Assembly & Drone Setup
  * **Corresponds to our:**
      * **[Phase 1: Core Drone Assembly & Basic Flight](docs/phases/phase-1-assembly.md)**
      * **[Phase 2: Companion Computer Setup](docs/phases/phase-2-companion-computer-setup.md)**
      * **[Phase 3: Connecting Brain to Muscle](docs/phases/phase-3-brain-muscle-connection.md)**
      * **[Phase 4: Basic Autonomous Flight](docs/phases/phase-4-basic-autonomous-flight.md)**
  * **Reasoning:** We break this down into smaller steps: build the body (P1), prepare the brain (P2), connect them (P3), and then test the basic connection with an autonomous flight (P4).

  ### Your Phase 3: Fire Detection & Analysis
  * **Corresponds to our:**
      * **[Phase 5: Sensor Integration & Data Capture](docs/phases/phase-5-sensor-integration.md)**
      * **[Phase 6: Onboard AI Development & Testing](docs/phases/phase-6-onboard-ai-development.md)**
  * **Reasoning:** First, we give the drone its senses by connecting the cameras (P5), and then we teach it how to interpret what it sees with the AI model (P6).

  ---

  ### Your Phase 4: Resource Estimation & Suppression Strategy
  * **Corresponds to our:**
      * **[Phase 9: Refinement & Advanced Features](docs/phases/phase-9-refinement-and-advanced-features.md)**
  * **Reasoning:** These advanced analytical features, like resource calculation and strategy, are built on top of the core system once it's fully integrated.

  ---

  ### Your Phase 5: Communication & Data Transmission
  * **Corresponds to our:**
      * **[Phase 8: HQ Communication & Dashboard](docs/phases/phase-8-hq-communication.md)** (Partially)
  * **Reasoning:** This phase focuses on the drone's ability to send the data.

  ---

  ### Your Phase 6: Control Dashboard / HQ Interface
  * **Corresponds to our:**
      * **[Phase 8: HQ Communication & Dashboard](docs/phases/phase-8-hq-communication.md)** (Partially)
  * **Reasoning:** This phase focuses on the ground station's ability to receive and display the data. We've combined both into a single, cohesive communication phase.

  ---

  ### Your Phase 7: Testing, Simulation & Iteration
  * **Corresponds to our:**
      * **[Phase 7: Full System Integration](docs/phases/phase-7-full-system-integration.md)**
  * **Reasoning:** Our Phase 7 is the major integration test where all the individual modules are brought together for the first time to run a complete mission, which is the ultimate test.
