# 🚀 Implementation Plan: Fire Analysis and Response Drone System (F.A.R.D.S)

---

## 🧭 Phase 1: Planning & Research

### ✅ Tasks:
- Define the scope of the fire detection system (forest fire, urban fire, etc.)
- Research existing drone fire-detection technologies
- Identify hardware and software requirements
- Study drone flight regulations (DGCA, FAA, etc.)
- Divide project into modules:
  - Drone Navigation
  - Fire Detection & Analysis
  - Estimation Engine
  - Communication & Reporting
  - Control Dashboard

### 🎯 Goals:
- Confirm feasibility
- Prepare timeline, assign roles
- Finalize tech stack and platform tools

---

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Hardware Assembly & Drone Setup

### ✅ Tasks:
- Assemble drone frame (preferably quadcopter)
- Mount sensors:
  - GPS Module
  - Thermal Camera (FLIR or Seek Thermal)
  - IR Sensors
  - LIDAR (optional)
  - Onboard computer (Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano)
  - 4G/LTE Module
- Configure flight controller (PX4 / ArduPilot / DroneKit)
- Test basic navigation (takeoff, waypoint travel)

### 🎯 Goals:
- Drone is capable of autonomous navigation to GPS locations

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Fire Detection & Analysis

### ✅ Tasks:
- Use camera + OpenCV/TensorFlow to detect fire zones
- Analyze thermal data to identify heat spots
- Calculate estimated fire area (m²)
- Generate bounding boxes around fire zones
- Create basic fire magnitude score (Low, Medium, High)

### 🎯 Goals:
- System detects and quantifies fire from aerial view

---

## 📐 Phase 4: Resource Estimation & Suppression Strategy

### ✅ Tasks:
- Build a rule-based or AI system to estimate:
  - Fire area and spread
  - Required extinguishing material (water, foam, extinguishers)
- Include logic to suggest suppression start point (e.g., NW corner)
- Factor in wind, terrain, and heat direction (if available)

### 🎯 Goals:
- Provide resource and strategy output like:
  `"Start from NW. Use 5 extinguishers or 800L water."`

---

## 📤 Phase 5: Communication & Data Transmission

### ✅ Tasks:
- Set up 4G/LTE or WiFi communication system
- Use MQTT or HTTP to transmit data
- Send:
  - Fire area report (JSON)
  - Images or heatmaps
  - Drone status and location

### 🎯 Goals:
- HQ receives real-time data and visuals from drone

---

## 🖥️ Phase 6: Control Dashboard / HQ Interface

### ✅ Tasks:
- Develop Web or Mobile Dashboard to:
  - Display fire map and visuals
  - Show fire magnitude and resource estimate
  - Track drone status (battery, GPS, connectivity)
- Tools:
  - Frontend: React / Flutter
  - Backend: Node.js / Firebase / Flask
  - Maps: Leaflet / Mapbox / OpenStreetMap

### 🎯 Goals:
- HQ team sees a complete real-time picture with recommended actions

---

## 🔁 Phase 7: Testing, Simulation & Iteration

### ✅ Tasks:
- Simulate fire conditions using:
  - Heat sources (safe heat pads)
  - Printed fire images
  - Controlled field test
- Test:
  - Detection accuracy
  - Estimation logic
  - Live communication reliability

### 🎯 Goals:
- Ensure 80–90% reliability before final deployment

---

## 📝 Final Deliverables

- ✅ Fully functional drone system
- ✅ Sample reports and images captured
- ✅ Web/mobile dashboard
- ✅ Source code (hardware + software)
- ✅ Documentation and user manual
- ✅ Demo video or live presentation
- ✅ Final project report or academic paper

| 2-3  | Drone assembly + navigation setup              |
| 4    | Fire detection + image analysis                |
| 5    | Estimation model + suppression strategy        |
| 6    | Communication module + HQ dashboard            |
| 7    | Integration + simulation/testing               |
| 8    | Final documentation, video, and presentation   |
