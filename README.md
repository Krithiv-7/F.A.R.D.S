# 🔥 Fire Analysis and Response Drone System (F.A.R.D.S)

## 🧩 Overview
As part of a student-led initiative to develop rapid-response technologies for disaster management, our team proposes the design and implementation of a **multi-functional drone system** capable of autonomously identifying, analyzing, and assisting in combating fire outbreaks in remote or urban areas.

This drone system — **F.A.R.D.S** — will be equipped with fire detection, magnitude estimation, resource calculation, and strategic response planning capabilities.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a drone that can:

- 🚁 Autonomously navigate to detected fire regions.
- 📸 Capture images and videos for real-time analysis.
- 🔥 Estimate the **magnitude of fire**, including:
  - Area covered
  - Heat intensity
  - Spread pattern
- 🧯 Calculate the **approximate quantity of fire extinguishing resources** needed (e.g., extinguishers, water, retardants).
- 🧠 Suggest the **best starting point for suppression** (e.g., from which edge or center to begin).
- 📡 Transmit data (images, video, report) to the **HQ/server for fast emergency response**.

## 🧪 Scenario
### 🔥 Simulated Forest Fire - Case

- A **fire alert** is flagged by a local monitoring system via satellite or environmental sensors.
- The drone receives **coordinates of the flagged region**.
- It immediately **deploys to the site** (within 3–5 km range).
- Upon arrival, the drone:
  1. **Scans the area** using:
     - Thermal imaging camera
     - IR sensors
     - LIDAR mapping
  2. **Captures visuals & generates heat map**
  3. **Estimates**:
     - Fire magnitude (e.g., light, moderate, extreme)
     - Spread radius (e.g., 25m x 30m)
     - Fire spread direction (via wind + heat data)
  4. **Calculates suppression resources**:
     - ~4 fire extinguishers (Class A) for small zones
     - ~1000 liters water or chemical foam for larger zones
  5. **Suggests suppression strategy**:
     - Start from northwest edge due to southeast wind flow
     - Use foam to block spread, then water
  6. **Transmits report and visuals** to HQ via 4G/5G or satellite uplink
