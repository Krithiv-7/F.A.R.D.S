# Phase 9: Refinement & Advanced Features

  **Objective:** To evolve the working prototype into a feature-complete system by integrating advanced sensors and implementing the final decision-making algorithms as outlined in the original project proposal.

  ### Part A: LIDAR Integration for Precise Area Mapping

  This replaces visual estimation with highly accurate laser measurement.

  1.  **Component:** A lightweight 2D LIDAR scanner (e.g., RPLIDAR A1/A2).
  2.  **Connection:** Connect the LIDAR scanner to the Raspberry Pi, typically via USB.
  3.  **Software:**
      * Install the official Python SDK for your chosen LIDAR model.
      * Write a script to initialize the scanner, retrieve a 360-degree scan, and process the resulting point cloud data.
  4.  **Integration:**
      * Modify the `master_mission.py` script.
      * During the search pattern, when fire is detected, trigger a LIDAR scan.
      * Develop an algorithm to analyze the point cloud data in conjunction with the fire's GPS location to calculate the precise square meter area of the fire's perimeter. This will be far more accurate than image-based estimation.

  ### Part B: Advanced AI Model Development

  This involves creating new models for the more complex analytical tasks.

  1.  **Fire Spread Prediction:**
      * **Data Input:** Use the thermal camera data to track the movement of hotspots over a short period (e.g., 30 seconds). Also, integrate a weather API call (using the drone's GPS location) to get real-time wind speed and direction.
      * **Algorithm:** Create a new function that correlates the direction of fire growth with the wind vector. This will predict the most likely spread direction (e.g., "Northeast").
  2.  **Resource Estimation Model:**
      * **Data:** This is a research-intensive step. You will need to create a dataset (e.g., in a simple CSV file) that links fire sizes (in sq. meters) and intensity levels (e.g., 'low', 'moderate', 'high' from thermal data) to the approximate quantity of extinguishing resources needed.
      * **Algorithm:** Write a function that takes the LIDAR-measured area and the thermal intensity as input and looks up the corresponding resource requirements from your dataset.

  ### Part C: The Final Strategy Report

  This is the culmination of all the drone's analysis.

  1.  **Integrate into Master Script:** In `master_mission.py`, after a fire has been detected and analyzed by the visual, thermal, and LIDAR systems, the script should compile a final, comprehensive report.
  2.  **Update `send_report` function:** Modify the reporting function from Phase 8 to include these new data points in the JSON payload sent to HQ:
      * `fireArea_sqm` (from LIDAR)
      * `spreadDirection` (from AI)
      * `estimatedResources` (a dictionary with water/foam amounts)
      * `suggestedPath` (a string generated by the algorithm, e.g., "Begin suppression from Southwest edge.")

  ### Part D: Dashboard Enhancement

  The HQ dashboard needs to be updated to display this new, rich information.

  1.  **Modify `hq_server.py`:** Update the HTML template in the `dashboard()` function.
  2.  **Add New Fields:** Add sections to the HTML to display the Fire Area, Spread Direction, and a list of Estimated Resources. This gives the human operator the complete picture at a glance.

  ### Phase 9 Milestone: Full Operational Capability

  **The project is complete when the drone can autonomously perform a mission and send a full report to the HQ dashboard that includes:**
  * A visual image of the fire.
  * Its precise GPS location.
  * An accurate area measurement in square meters from the LIDAR.
  * A predicted spread direction based on sensor data and wind.
  * A calculated estimate of the resources needed for suppression.
  * A suggested strategic starting point for firefighters.

  **At this point, F.A.R.D.S. has met all the objectives laid out in the initial case scenario.**
